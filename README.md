I'm Drew, a US cyber engineer with a passion for security, privacy, and sentient rights. I spend most of my online time collaborating with cyber citizens across academia, corporate, and government domains. Occasionally, I contribute my thoughts and insights to the community through social media, articles, and  publications like [X64.ONL](https://x64.onl).
